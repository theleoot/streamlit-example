# Welcome to Albedo Data Prediction App!!

Edit `/streamlit_app.py` to customize this app to your heart's desire. :heart:

In this code, we will explore the importance and relevance of using Ridge Regression (specific AI) model to predict data from Asteroid Albedos from Stellar Occultations research. We will also examine the benefits of using this model in astronomy research and provide examples of its successful implementation.

If you have any questions, checkout our [documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io) and [community
